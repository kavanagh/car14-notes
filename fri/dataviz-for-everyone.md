**4 approaches at Propublica**

* completely different view for small screens (where congress stands on guns). Pick the parts you want to emphasise. Redirect or CSS.
* Change the layout. State-by-state waiting times. Temp-worker regulations around the world.
* Hide the problematic elements.
* No mobile view. Doesn't mean it should be broken or not functional.
