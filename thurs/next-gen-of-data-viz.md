# The next generation of data viz

By Alberto Cairo

GraphTV. TV Ratings.
Visualising Buffy. Character on-screen time.

Focus too much on the  tech side of viz. Plot.ly, Graft.ly, CartoDB, oo. Coding is nice to learn. Don't focus on the tools when thinking about future. D3 wont be here forever.

Future is based on principles.

* Designers, journos will become better with numbers (and statistics) and evidence. Help lead the way in the newsroom to raise numeracy and visual skills. Too much over simplification, too much summary, unintentional lying. Only need basic knowledge of stats to spot bad viz.
* Need context.
* Process of critique. Be open to receive critique.
* Patternicity: "finding meaningful patterns in meaningless noise"
* Books. The Believing Brain & Thinking Fast and Slow.
* The first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool" -- Richard Feymann
* Danger of producing narratives based on patternicity.
* Election result map, Ukraine. texty.org.ua Patterns got oversimplified narrative. Nuanced details.
* Tell the reader about the complexity of the data.
* Pay attention to the data that might disprove our idea/hypothysis.
* John Snow, map of Soho. Trying to prove patterns of cholera case. Best examples of data jornualism ever. Didnt just pay attention to his own data and thesis. Look for data to disprove.
* Don't have to be high-end data analyist. Just need to be honest.

Prediction 2: There will be a return to the foundations of visualisation.

5 features of a great infographic.

1. Truthful (best understanding of the truth)
1. Functional (function constrains the variety of forms)
1. Beautiful - attract the audience you are appealing to. (mandatory basic visual communication and graphic design for journos)
1. Insightful. Reveal things that are important, unexpected. Help the reader. Don't hide simplify by hiding complexity.
1. Enlightening. Reveal something i didn't know before.

Too many designers focus on the beauty.

> We need to fear the consequences of our work more than we love the cleverness of our ideas.

The great innovator: William Playfair.

Many editors not willing to risk and innovate. "Our users will not understand this complex graphic". "Dont fear innovation, but at the same time be skeptical about innovation"

Prediction 3: we will embrace that designers can encode their data more than once. 

Too many use just one visualisation.

Multiple representations for multiple functions and multiple perspectives.

Sketches and visual mockups given to deveoper.

Prediction 4: designers will learn writing is as important as drawing.  Need good annotations. Symbiosis of words and pictures.

A visualisation is something "to be read" not "to be seen". The editorial voice is very important.

Simplest graphics are impressive.

Prediction 5: data-driven motion graphics will become huge.

Robert Reich, 'Inequality for all'.
Hans Rosling: good example of annotation with a person pointing.

Prediction 6: news viz designers will asume that becoming proficient at using technologies 

We should never forget that our first responsibility is towards the planet, humankind, citizens, and after
