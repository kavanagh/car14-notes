User-centric design.

## BBC Online workflow. Helane.
Refine Maps.

1. Get a definition onto a sheet of paper. Figure out who has the right to have an opinion. Weekly meeting. Write a headline. Display it.
2. Brainstorming. Quantity not quality. Understand the editorial process. Editorial shouldn't come to use with ready made idea. Lot of sketches. Many different people/s  ideas
3. Wireframing. Test early and often. Proto.io. Paper prototype. Quick and rough but you do need to prepare figure out what you need to know.
4. Design and perfect. Mobile first.
5.  Deliver. check. test.

## NYT: What's the story? What can I do here?

Hard time describing what we do. We are a product development team. 

Fight need to add features. Newsroom good a doing small, not big. Feature creep.

What's the story. Get a headline.

Tabs are lazy.

All 'of a piece' - integrated.

Deprioritise features.

Layer cake design.

Using event tracker to see what users are doing.

Needed to get a lot better at building a product.

User centered design.
